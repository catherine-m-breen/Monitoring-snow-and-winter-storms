# Monitoring-snow-and-winter-storms

Jupyter notebook with neural network models for detecting snow cover in camera trap images. The models use a labeled training dataset from viltkamera.nina.no. 
Images are labeled for snow cover on a scale of 0-4. 0 corresponds to ~0% snow cover, 1 to ~25% snow cover, 2 to ~50% snow cover, 3 to ~75% snow cover, and 4 to ~100% snow cover.
